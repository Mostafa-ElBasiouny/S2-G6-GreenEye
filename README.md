Optimized workflow, increased efficiency, maximum yields, and perfect produce quality.

If this seems like something you are willing to get from your greenhouse - then the Green Eye greenhouse management application is a perfect solution for you.

Our modular greenhouse management system allows our users to monitor and control their greenhouse(s) using the presinstalled HMI\GUI panel in a reliable and effective manner.
With the Green Eye connected to the greenhouse sensors, controls, and HMI panel, our users are empowered to review all the current sensor readings in the form of graphs and charts and control things like air humidity, soil humidity, soil fertility, soild acidity, and temperature inside the greenhouse all from one place.
