Optimized workflow, increased efficiency, maximum yields, and perfect produce quality

If this seems like something you are willing to get from your greenhouse, then the `Green Eye ðŸŒ±` greenhouse management application is the perfect solution for you.

Our modular greenhouse management system allows our users to monitor and control their greenhouse(s) using the preinstalled **HMI-GUI** panel in a reliable and effective manner.
With `Green Eye ðŸŒ±` connected to the greenhouse *sensors*, *controls*, and *HMI panel*, our users are empowered to review all the current sensor readings in the form of *graphs* and *charts* and, from one place, be able to control sensors like:
- PH
- COâ‚‚
- UV
- Temperature
